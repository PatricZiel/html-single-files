This project acts as an container for single-html-file-projects.

tictactoe / newTTT:
tictactoe was my first little project as an hobby and I just randomly added features, i wanten it to contain.
newTTT was done later as I was teaching a friend. I also used a little different approach for the tictactoe logic.

2048:
A self made copy of the game "2048" - popular on mobile phones.

NotePlayer:
Since I love playing the piano, I meet some people who like to learn to play the piano themself and therefor I wanted to make this Project to help them learn playing some easy pieces.
I had some contact to LilyPond a while ago to write my first notes and I decidet to use and understand that format in this application.
This project is evergrowing, won't be finished and will be restartet with object-orientation in Java.
